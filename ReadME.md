## Technologies

I used **HTML** to create the structure of the website with a title, forms, and buttons.
**CSS** was used to style and color HTML elements.
**Javascript** was used alongside **Node** and **Express** to create an API with routes and numerous functions that acted as middleware to interact with these routes.
